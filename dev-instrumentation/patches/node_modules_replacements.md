This folder can contain files mirroring node_modules paths to be copied into place by apply.sh.

Example structure:

patches/node_modules/react-native-css-interop/dist/metro/index.js   # your instrumented file
patches/node_modules/@expo/metro-config/build/babel-transformer.js # your instrumented file

Place exact files under `patches` with the same relative path as they appear under node_modules.
